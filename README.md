# GDPong - a modern Pong reimplementation

## 1. How it is made
**GDPong** uses the **Godot Engine**, which is a fully open-source, modern, game engine capable of 2D and 3D scene generation. In the case of this particular project, **Godot** is using the **GDExtension** feature to execute game code written using **Rust**, instead of the proprietary **GDScript** scripting language.

## 2. Resources
The implementation of this Pong remake uses resources that are publicly available: 
 * [*The Rust Programming Language - Book*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
 * [*Godot Engine Docs*](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)
 * [*Godot Rust - Book*](https://godot-rust.github.io/book)

Thanks to these resources, anyone can easily start implementing their game using Godot Engine and its Rust binding features.
